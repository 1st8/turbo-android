## Running the Demo App

The demo apps bundled with the library work best with the [Turbolinks Demo App](https://github.com/basecamp/turbolinks-demo). You can follow the instructions in that repo to start up the server.

### Start the Demo Android App

- Ensure the demo server and Android device are on the same network.
- Start up the demo server per its instructions.
- Go to [Contants.kt](demoapp/src/main/kotlin/com/basecamp/turbolinks/demo/util/Constants.kt).
- Find the `BASE_URL` String at the top of the class. Change the IP to your IP.
- Build/run the app to your device.
