# Running the Demo Android App

To run the demo app on your Android device, clone this repo, open the directory in Android Studio, and run the `demo` module.

The demo is a small app to demonstrate how to use Turbo with a native app. The web demo site lives at [https://turbo-native-demo.glitch.me](https://turbo-native-demo.glitch.me) and its source code is available [here](https://github.com/basecamp/turbo-native-demo).
